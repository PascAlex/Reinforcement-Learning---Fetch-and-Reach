# Reinforcement-Learning---Fetch-and-Reach
#Environment: 7 DOF open-chain stationary robot


Task: Fetch and reach: the robot moves its end-effector to a certain goal position



Tools: OpenAi Gym: Toolkit for simulated robotics environments
       Mujoco: Physics engine for model-based control tasks
       Stable-baselines3: a set of implementations of RL algorithms




Algorithms: DDPG, Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3), Soft Actor Critic(SAC), Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
